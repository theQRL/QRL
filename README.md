# QRL - Quantum Resistant Ledger 

> Python-based blockchain ledger utilizing hash-based one-time merkle tree signature scheme (XMSS) instead of ECDSA. Proof-of-work block selection via the cryptonight algorithm. Late 2018 planned transition to POS with signed iterative hash chain reveal scheme which is both probabilistic and random (https://github.com/theQRL/pos).
>
> Hash-based signatures means larger transactions (6kb per tx, binary), longer keypair generation times and the need to record 'state' of transactions as each keypair can only be used once safely. Merkle tree usage enables a single address to be used for signing numerous transactions (up to 2^13 computationally easily enough). Transactions have an incremented nonce to allow wallets to know which MSS keypair to use - currently XMSS/W-OTS+ are natively supported.

# QRL Testnet (Instructions for beta testers)

You are welcome to install the beta version and join the testnet. Be aware that work is in progress and there might be frequent breaking changes. It's best to start with a fresh install of Ubuntu 16.04.

> Note if you build on a small VPS or other light weight hardware you may run into issues building the package. Make sure you have enough *RAM* and enable *SWAP* if needed.

### Minimum Hardware Requirements

* Most Linux / Unix based systems
* Any x86 or x64 based processor
* Support for AES-NI
* Enough space for the blockchain growth.

## Update and Dependencies 

```bash
# Issue the following command to update software

sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

### Dependencies

```bash
# Install the required packages for QRL

sudo apt-get -y install swig3.0 python3-dev python3-pip build-essential cmake pkg-config libssl-dev libffi-dev libhwloc-dev libboost-dev
```
* * * 

### OSX

```bash
brew update
brew install cmake python3 swig boost hwloc
```

* * * 


### Install QRL BETA-NET

```bash
# Install the qrl Package.

pip3 install -U qrl
```
If you need to add logging and troubleshoot issues enter:

```
# Add Logging for pip3 

pip3 install -U qrl --log ~/pip3-Qrl.log
```

* * *

## Wallet

Create a new wallet using the `qrl` command. After you create a wallet you can create a new `slaves.json` file and use it to mine with.

### Create New Wallet

```bash
# Create a new wallet

qrl wallet_gen
```
### Get Mnemonic/hexseed

```bash
# Get mnemonic phrase and hexseed

qrl wallet_secret
```  
### Recover QRL Wallet

```bash
# Options:
#	--seed-type	[hexseed|mnemonic]
#  	--help   	Show this message and exit.

qrl wallet_recover --seed-type mnemonic
```

### Generate a slaves.json file

Using the wallet you just created generate the slaves.json file against a know working node. You can switch the ip-address with a trusted open node.

```
# QRL Nodes

104.237.3.185
104.237.3.184
104.251.219.145
104.251.219.40
```

```bash
# Generate slaves.json file

qrl -r --host 104.237.3.185 slave_tx_generate 
```
This will prompt with some questions:

```bash
Src []:                 # The wallet you generated by #ID
Addr from []:           # (Leave blank in case same as source)
Number of slaves [0]:   # Enter 4
Access type [0]:        # Mining only or transfer coins [0],[1]
                        # 0 Gives all permissions from the master wallet to slave wallet
                        # 1 Only mining permissions to slave wallet
                            # This setting allows incoming only transfers (SAFE)
Fee [0.0]: 0            # How much fee
```

This will generate a `slaves.json` in the directory you are in. 

If you have saved the **Mnemonic** or **hexseed** somewhere safe you can delete the open `wallet.qrl` file and use the `slaves.json` file to mine with. 

Move it into your ~/.qrl directory. If needed create the directory.

* * * 

## Start QRL Node

Now that we have a `slaves.json` file in our ~/.qrl folder we can start qrl.

```bash
# start qrl

start_qrl
```

Check out all the options with a simple `start_qrl --help`

Using `screen` you can run in the background and reconnect later. You may need to install screen.

```bash
# run in background

screen -d -m start_qrl
```
You can see the progress in the `~/.qrl/qrl.log` file.

```bash
# watch the action with 

tail -f ~/.qrl/qrl.log
```

Please add any issues found here in GitHub. Thanks for helping run QRL Beta-Net!

## Windows :seedling:

*Windows support in the current version is limited. An alternative is to use an Ubuntu VM (virtualbox), or install Ubuntu using the Linux Subsystem for Windows.

### Ubuntu on Linux Subsystem for Windows

It is possible to run a QRL node using an Ubuntu Bash shell through the Linux Subsystem for Windows. 

Follow [these instructions](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/install-win10) to install Ubuntu using Linux Subsystem, start the Ubuntu bash shell, and then follow the previous instructions on setting up QRL.

*We are working on a solution to native Windows support*
